#Commands4J
 Commands4J is an easy-to-use command framework for [Discord4J](http://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J).
 
I could sit here and talk about how great Commands4J is, but that'd be pointless. Let me show you.
 
 Add a command:
 
 ```
 Command ping = new Command("ping", new Command.Options().withAliases("testAlias", "testAlias1"))
 					.onExecuted(context -> {
 						//Put what you want the command to do here.
 						//You can even easily get the arguments of the command easily!
 						String args[] = context.getArgs();
 					})
 					.onFailure((context, reason) -> {
 						//If the command fails, put what should happen here.
 					});
 ```
 
 Then all you have to do is register it! 
 
 `CommandRegistry.getRegistryForClient(the client object).register(ping);`
 
Isn't that easy? Using Commands.Options, you can even easily add aliases, require specific permissions, and more!
 
The default prefix is always `!`, but you can easily set it using `CommandRegistry.setPrefix("prefix")`.
